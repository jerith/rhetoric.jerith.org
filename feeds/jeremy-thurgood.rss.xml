My old blog probably isn't all that hard to find, but I
was a different person back then and I don't care enough about (most of) that
old content to migrate it. I'm not going delete it or anything, and I'll
probably make some effort to preserve it if the service it uses goes away, but
very little of it is relevant to the person I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm probably going to be mostly (but not exclusively) posting stuff about
software development here. I'm not sure exactly what the mix of topics will be,
but there are things I want to write down somewhere more permanent than an IRC
conversation. Most of those are about programming, and many of them will amount
to nothing once I actually sit down to flesh them out. We'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to write for an audience who is interested in many of the same things
I'm interested in, but who don't necessarily know me personally and therefore
don't much care about the sorts of things that are only really important to
friends and family. When I look back on things I wrote in the past, I find the
stuff that's aged best is the stuff that's less personal. If you want to keep
up with the (mostly boring) details of my daily life, you're better off
chatting to me on IRC or over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jeremy Thurgood</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:jerith.org,2014-07-08:posts/2014/07/first-post/</guid></item></channel></rss>
