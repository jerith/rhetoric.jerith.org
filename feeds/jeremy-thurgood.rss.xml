in which &lt;a href="http://anil.recoil.org/"&gt;Anil Madhavapeddy&lt;/a&gt; talks about OCaml and &lt;a href="http://openmirage.org/"&gt;Mirage&lt;/a&gt;.
While OCaml isn't the primary focus of the interview, the reasons it was chosen
as the basis for Mirage intrigued me enough that I was inspired to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full text of &lt;a href="https://realworldocaml.org/"&gt;Real World OCaml&lt;/a&gt; is available for free online, so I
dove right in and found it to be engaging and informative. I haven't quite
finished reading it yet (Part III is mostly details that aren't relevant to the
writing of small program), but within a week I was comfortable enough to start
writing a prototype &lt;a href="https://github.com/praekelt/vumi"&gt;Vumi&lt;/a&gt; worker in OCaml. (More on that in a future
post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I saw a reference to &lt;a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/categories/ocaml/"&gt;a series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt;
documenting &lt;a href="http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/"&gt;0install&lt;/a&gt;'s transition from Python to OCaml. They're
well worth reading for anyone interested in the costs and benefits of writing a
nontrivial software system in OCaml. While writing this post (the next
paragraph, actually) I saw a recommendation for this very useful
&lt;a href="http://blog.nullspace.io/beginners-guide-to-ocaml-beginners-guides.html"&gt;beginner's guide to OCaml beginner's guides&lt;/a&gt; and read through
it. Both of these were mentioned in the #ocaml IRC channel on freenode, which
is probably the best programming language channel I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm not yet fluent enough in OCaml to write idiomatic code, I'm far
enough along the learning curve that I'm able to solve real problems in the
language as long as I have language and library references handy. OCaml is
notable in that I've reached this point without discovering anything I hate
about it. The only other language that remained hate-free this far into the
learning process was Python, and it's still the language I'm least grumpy
about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to learning more about OCaml by (hopefully) building some
useful software in it over the next few weeks. It's certainly the language I've
been happiest about learning nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jeremy Thurgood</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2014 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:rhetoric.jerith.org,2014-07-12:posts/2014/07/first-look-at-ocaml/</guid><category>language</category><category>ocaml</category></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>http://rhetoric.jerith.org/posts/2014/07/first-post/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is my new blog. My old blog probably isn't all that hard to find, but I
was a different person back then and I don't care enough about (most of) that
old content to migrate it. I'm not going delete it or anything, and I'll
probably make some effort to preserve it if the service it uses goes away, but
very little of it is relevant to the person I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm probably going to be mostly (but not exclusively) posting stuff about
software development here. I'm not sure exactly what the mix of topics will be,
but there are things I want to write down somewhere more permanent than an IRC
conversation. Most of those are about programming, and many of them will amount
to nothing once I actually sit down to flesh them out. We'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to write for an audience who is interested in many of the same things
I'm interested in, but who don't necessarily know me personally and therefore
don't much care about the sorts of things that are only really important to
friends and family. When I look back on things I wrote in the past, I find the
stuff that's aged best is the stuff that's less personal. If you want to keep
up with the (mostly boring) details of my daily life, you're better off
chatting to me on IRC or over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jeremy Thurgood</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:rhetoric.jerith.org,2014-07-08:posts/2014/07/first-post/</guid></item></channel></rss>
