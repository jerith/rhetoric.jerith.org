{"pages":[{"text":"I recently listened to an episode of Software Engineering Radio in which Anil Madhavapeddy talks about OCaml and Mirage . While OCaml isn't the primary focus of the interview, the reasons it was chosen as the basis for Mirage intrigued me enough that I was inspired to take a look. The full text of Real World OCaml is available for free online, so I dove right in and found it to be engaging and informative. I haven't quite finished reading it yet (Part III is mostly details that aren't relevant to the writing of small program), but within a week I was comfortable enough to start writing a prototype Vumi worker in OCaml. (More on that in a future post.) At this point, I saw a reference to a series of blog posts documenting 0install 's transition from Python to OCaml. They're well worth reading for anyone interested in the costs and benefits of writing a nontrivial software system in OCaml. While writing this post (the next paragraph, actually) I saw a recommendation for this very useful beginner's guide to OCaml beginner's guides and read through it. Both of these were mentioned in the #ocaml IRC channel on freenode, which is probably the best programming language channel I've seen. While I'm not yet fluent enough in OCaml to write idiomatic code, I'm far enough along the learning curve that I'm able to solve real problems in the language as long as I have language and library references handy. OCaml is notable in that I've reached this point without discovering anything I hate about it. The only other language that remained hate-free this far into the learning process was Python, and it's still the language I'm least grumpy about. I'm looking forward to learning more about OCaml by (hopefully) building some useful software in it over the next few weeks. It's certainly the language I've been happiest about learning nearly a decade.","tags":"programming","loc":"http://rhetoric.jerith.org/posts/2014/07/first-look-at-ocaml/","title":"First Look at OCaml"},{"text":"This is my new blog. My old blog probably isn't all that hard to find, but I was a different person back then and I don't care enough about (most of) that old content to migrate it. I'm not going delete it or anything, and I'll probably make some effort to preserve it if the service it uses goes away, but very little of it is relevant to the person I am today. I'm probably going to be mostly (but not exclusively) posting stuff about software development here. I'm not sure exactly what the mix of topics will be, but there are things I want to write down somewhere more permanent than an IRC conversation. Most of those are about programming, and many of them will amount to nothing once I actually sit down to flesh them out. We'll see how it goes. I intend to write for an audience who is interested in many of the same things I'm interested in, but who don't necessarily know me personally and therefore don't much care about the sorts of things that are only really important to friends and family. When I look back on things I wrote in the past, I find the stuff that's aged best is the stuff that's less personal. If you want to keep up with the (mostly boring) details of my daily life, you're better off chatting to me on IRC or over a beer.","tags":"misc","loc":"http://rhetoric.jerith.org/posts/2014/07/first-post/","title":"First Post"}]}
